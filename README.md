# This is the beginning stages and interworkings to design a PWA that will allow users to navigate the application and plan their vacations accordingly to what best suits their needs. It will have the ability to showcase and allow for the booking of many different destination spots. 
In order to view the prototype design, you will need to download the files into your local environment to access the index.html file on your computer as the website does not yet have a running web address.

The service worker is a crucial component that managages network request and allows for the offline capabilites. It implements a cache strategy to make for quicker load times and a better user experience.
The manifest.json breaks down how the PWA will appear when installed onto a device. I set the name, icons, theme, background, url and display to standalone to achieve this.
